# patilkunals.github.io

This repository hosts the personal portfolio website for **Kunal Patil**. To publish:

1. Create a GitHub repository named exactly `patilkunals.github.io`.
2. Add files from this project into the repository (index.html, assets/, .github/).
3. Commit & push to `main`.
4. In GitHub repo settings > Pages, set source to `gh-pages` branch (if using the Actions workflow) or set source to `main`/root for direct publishing.

Customise:
- Replace `/assets/img/avatar.jpg` with your real portrait.
- Replace `your.email@domain.com` in `index.html` and `script.js` with your contact email.
- Drop `Kunal-Patil-Resume.pdf` into `/assets`.

Extras I can provide:
- A ZIP of the project and a GitHub Actions secret setup guide.
- An exported PNG Open Graph image (if you prefer raster).
